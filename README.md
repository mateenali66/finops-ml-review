## Study Overview

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Review Type** | Systematic Review (PRISMA 2020) |
| **Time Period** | 2019-2025 |
| **Databases** | IEEE Xplore, ACM DL, Springer, ScienceDirect, arXiv, Google Scholar, Semantic Scholar |
| **Included Studies** | 75 academic papers + 4 grey literature sources (79 total) |
| **Quality Assessment** | 50 high quality, 25 moderate quality (academic); all 4 grey sources rated high (AACODS) |
