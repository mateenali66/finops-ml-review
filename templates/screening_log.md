# Screening Decision Log

This document records the screening process for the systematic review.

## Stage 1: Title and Abstract Screening

### Coding Scheme for Exclusion

| Code | Reason |
|------|--------|
| A | Not ML-focused |
| B | Not cost-related |
| C | Outside date range (before 2019) |
| D | Non-English |
| E | Insufficient length (< 4 pages) |

### Screening Statistics

| Category | Count |
|----------|-------|
| Total records after deduplication | 134 |
| Included for full-text review | 106 |
| Excluded at title/abstract | 28 |
| Uncertain (retained for full-text) | 14 |

## Stage 2: Full-Text Assessment

### Full-Text Exclusion Reasons

| Reason | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Not ML-focused (merely mentions ML) | 8 |
| Not cost-related (pure performance optimization) | 7 |
| Insufficient methodological detail | 5 |
| Duplicate content across venues | 4 |
| Workshop paper under 4 pages | 3 |
| **Total excluded** | **27** |

### Final Inclusion

| Category | Count |
|----------|-------|
| Academic studies included | 75 |
| Grey literature included | 4 |
| **Total included** | **79** |

## Uncertain Records Resolution

9 records required formal re-evaluation after initial screening.

### Resolution Process
1. Each uncertain record was set aside during initial screening
2. After completing the full initial pass, uncertain records were re-evaluated
3. Each record was assessed a second time against inclusion/exclusion criteria
4. Written justification was documented for each decision

### Results
- 7 ultimately included
- 2 ultimately excluded

## Pilot Phase

- 20 records (approximately 20% of initial corpus) were screened in a pilot phase
- Pilot calibrated inclusion/exclusion criteria interpretation
- Key clarification: papers addressing "cloud resource optimization" without explicit cost metrics were included if cost implications were reasonably inferable from the optimization objective

## Intra-Rater Reliability

- 20% random sample re-screened after a two-week interval
- Agreement between initial and repeat screening exceeded 90%
- Discrepancies were in borderline cases; all resolved conservatively (toward inclusion)

## Notes

- All screening decisions were made by a single reviewer (sole-authored review)
- Conservative inclusion policy applied for borderline studies
- This limitation is acknowledged in Section 6.3 of the manuscript
