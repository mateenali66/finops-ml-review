## Inclusion Criteria

| Code | Criterion | Rationale |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| IC1 | Peer-reviewed papers, preprints, or substantial industry reports published 2019-2025 | Capture FinOps emergence (founded 2019) and LLM developments |
| IC2 | Addresses ML/AI techniques for cloud cost optimization, prediction, or management | Core scope of review |
| IC3 | Presents empirical results, systematic analysis, or comprehensive framework | Ensure methodological substance |
| IC4 | Full text available in English | Accessibility and reviewer competence |

## Exclusion Criteria

| Code | Criterion | Rationale |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| EC1 | Pure marketing content without technical substance | Quality threshold |
| EC2 | Duplicate content across venues | Avoid double-counting |
| EC3 | Papers focusing solely on performance optimization without cost consideration | Scope boundary |
| EC4 | Workshop papers or extended abstracts under 4 pages | Insufficient detail for extraction |
| EC5 | Non-cloud cost optimization (general ML papers) | Relevance filter |

## Screening Process

### Stage 1: Title and Abstract Screening
- All records imported to Zotero
- Automated deduplication
- Classification: Include / Exclude / Uncertain
- Uncertain records retained for full-text review

### Exclusion Codes (Stage 1)
- A: Not ML-focused
- B: Not cost-related
- C: Outside date range
- D: Non-English
- E: Insufficient length

### Stage 2: Full-Text Assessment
- Retrieve full texts
- Assess against all criteria
- Document exclusion reasons with justifications

### Pilot Screening
- 20 records (20% sample)
- Calibrate criteria interpretation
- Clarification: Papers on "cloud resource optimization" included if cost implications inferable

### Disagreement Resolution
- Discuss with reference to criteria
- If unresolved, provisionally include and flag
- 7 records required resolution; 5 included, 2 excluded
