## Notes

- This review was not pre-registered in PROSPERO as PROSPERO does not accept computing/software engineering reviews.
- The review protocol, search strings, and all screening decisions are deposited in this repository.
- As a sole-authored review, dual screening was not possible. Mitigation strategies are described in Section 3.3.3 and Section 6.3.
